# TODO

**Last updated:** 2026-04-27

Single source of truth for all remaining work. Organized by priority.

---

## Phase 13: Ship It (blocking launch)

- [x] **Deploy dashboard** — shipped 2026-04-21 (commit `fb216e0`), live at https://dashboard-production-cee3.up.railway.app/
- [ ] **Set `DASHBOARD_URL`** env var in Railway backend (needed for Stripe checkout + OAuth redirects). Value: `https://dashboard-production-cee3.up.railway.app`. ~2 min via Railway → ai-sec service → Variables.
- [x] **Apply migration `20260427000000_telnyx_provisioning.sql` to production Supabase.** Done 2026-04-27. Dropped `vapi_assistant_id`/`vapi_phone_number_id` (verified empty across all 3 tenants beforehand), added `telnyx_phone_number_id`. Side effect: also applied `20260423000000_phone_verifications.sql` which had been sitting unapplied — SMS OTP table now exists in prod, fixing a silent runtime gap.
- [ ] **Telnyx ticket #2850682** — phone number `+1-630-937-9478` returning "not in service" from PSTN. See `TICKET_SUPPORT.md`. Awaiting LERG investigation. Blocks all live-call testing.
- [ ] **Beta testing with DynaTire** — blocked on phone working
- [x] **BUG-072**: Front Desk scheduler shift bars not rendering — root cause: seed data populated legacy `employee_shifts` table instead of `employee_schedule`. Fixed seed to use `employee_schedule` (2 weeks of date-based shifts).

---

## CI Rot — RESOLVED (2026-04-30)

Done in a focused pass. Two-job CI gate now runs on every push/PR to main:

- **Backend job:** `npm ci`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (1,477 tests).
- **Dashboard job:** `npm ci`, `npm test` (495 tests). Typecheck step
  intentionally skipped — see follow-up below.

**Deleted as zombies** (referenced paths/scripts that don't exist in this
repo, leftover from the ai-secretary import):

- `pnpm-workspace-sanity.yml` — no `pnpm-workspace.yaml` exists.
- `ci-smoke-assume-tenant.yml` — references `__tests__/auth.assume-tenant.test.ts`.
- `ci-smoke-calendar-appointments.yml` — references `__tests__/calendar.test.ts`.
- `pr-smoke-servers.yml` — references `seed-demo.sh`, port 3000, `admin@test.com`.

The smoke workflows' value is subsumed by the unit suite (calendar, auth,
appointment tests live under `src/` and run via the new backend job).

### Follow-up

- [x] **Re-enable dashboard typecheck in CI.** Done 2026-04-30. Fixed
  the three pre-existing test-file type errors that had been blocking
  the gate: `Boom` now declares `: never` return type;
  `process.env.NODE_ENV` writes replaced with `vi.stubEnv`/`vi.unstubAllEnvs`;
  `BusinessSettingsView.test.tsx` `window.location` override now uses
  `@ts-expect-error` (matching the existing pattern in
  `ErrorBoundary.test.tsx`). Dashboard CI job now runs `npx tsc --noEmit`
  + `npm test` (495 tests, all passing).

## Voice AI Migration: Vapi → LiveKit Agents

Migration shipped in `661d21d` (2026-04-27). Vapi account deleted. Truth-of-state lives in `docs/FRAMEWORK_MIGRATIONS.md`.

**Open follow-ups:**
- **Phase 4 — native xAI Grok TTS in agent worker.** Replace `openai.TTS` at `agent/src/index.ts:122,150` with a custom `GrokTTS` class hitting `https://api.x.ai/v1/tts` directly. Validatable via LiveKit playground (no PSTN dependency). ~1–2 hr. Tracked as `NEEDS-REFACTORING.md` item #9.
- **Phase 5 — integration testing with DynaTire.** Blocked on Telnyx ticket #2850682 (PSTN reachability for `+1-630-937-9478`). See `TICKET_SUPPORT.md`.
- **Phase 6 — dashboard updates** (call status, live transcription). Design TBD; currently shows post-call summaries only.

---

## Documentation Cleanup (Vapi → Telnyx/LiveKit)

Doc Phase 1 inventory completed 2026-04-27. 17 files contain 177 Vapi references; 76 are historical (leave alone), 101 are actionable. Three classes:

- **Category A — pure renames** (41 hits): stack listings, env var lists, file references. Mechanical.
- **Category C — stale env vars** (22 hits): `VAPI_API_KEY`, `VAPI_SERVER_URL_SECRET` documented in setup guides. Mechanical removal.
- **Category B — architectural** (38 hits): `improvement-ideas.md` and `docs/IMPROVEMENT_IDEAS.md` have proposed refactor tasks that assume the old Vapi shape. Need review — some tasks may need rewording, others may need to be dropped entirely now that the architecture changed.

**Files affected** (from inventory): README.md, CLAUDE.md, SUMMARY-2026-04-24-0030.md, improvement-ideas.md, docs/IMPROVEMENT_IDEAS.md, docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/DEPLOYMENT.md, docs/FRAMEWORK_MIGRATIONS.md, docs/TODO.md, docs/PLAN.md, docs/UI_UX_DESIGN.md, docs/DESIGN_HANDOFF.md, docs/DIAGRAMS.md, docs/BUGS.md, .remember/state.md, src/services/MIGRATED_FROM_AI_SECRETARY.md.

- [x] **Phase 2a (mechanical):** Category A + C renames across the authoritative docs. Done 2026-04-27 in commit `33b685c` — README, CLAUDE.md, docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md, docs/DEPLOYMENT.md (incl. Phase 6 rewrite), docs/IMPROVEMENT_IDEAS.md updated; every remaining Vapi mention in those files is correctly historical.
- [x] **Phase 2b:** done 2026-04-30. Reviewed all 9 actionable Vapi-shaped references across both files. Result: 5 tasks dropped (3 TTS — `src/routes/tts.ts` deleted in `661d21d`; 1 provisioning Vapi-cleanup helper — single-step Telnyx release doesn't justify extraction; 1 analytics placeholder copy — already shipped with LiveKit wording). 2 tasks reworded (provisioning status helper, voice.ts route split — still valid, just stale terminology). 1 Status parenthetical cleaned up in `docs/IMPROVEMENT_IDEAS.md`. Remaining Vapi mentions are tombstones marking dropped tasks, not actionable work.
- [ ] **Reconcile the stale Voice AI Migration section above** with truth from `docs/FRAMEWORK_MIGRATIONS.md` (status note added in `33b685c`; still need to delete the stale phase list entirely).
- [x] **Role clarity for improvement-ideas files (instead of consolidation).** Done 2026-04-30. Phase 1 inventory mislabeled these as duplicates. They are two distinct files with different origins and formats: `docs/IMPROVEMENT_IDEAS.md` is the curated review-phase backlog (160 tasks across 10 phases, dated 2026-04-10/11, capitalized titles, no Self-Review footers). `improvement-ideas.md` is an automated daily-journal feed (dates 2026-04-20–25, "Self-Review" sections after each batch, lowercase titles, includes Tradeoff/Effort vs Gain blocks). Both stay; consolidation would lose information. `docs/TODO.md:172` already treats `docs/IMPROVEMENT_IDEAS.md` as the authoritative backlog.
- [x] **Within-file dedup pass on `improvement-ideas.md`.** Done 2026-04-30. Awk-based dedup keyed on exact `### Task:` titles: 13 distinct titles had duplicates, totaling 21 dropped task blocks (4× of the syncOrchestrator fan-out execution and fan-out logs tasks; 3× of the resource-route validation, ScheduleEntry rename, sendSuccess pilot, and resource update field assembly tasks; 2× of seven other tasks). File shrank 1641 → 1323 lines (-318). Tombstones, Self-Review structure, and tenant-Vapi historical references all preserved. **Open follow-up:** the automated journal generator that writes this file is producing the duplicates — without fixing it, the next run re-introduces them. Track that as a generator-side fix, not a doc fix.
- [ ] **Within-file dedup pass on `docs/IMPROVEMENT_IDEAS.md`** (the curated backlog). Discovered 2026-04-30 while attempting to add a TOC: the file has the same dysfunction as the journal feed — 70+ section headers with duplicates like `## Ideas — 2026-04-11 (Integration Workflow Reviewed)` appearing 6+ times. The audit's "160 tasks across 10 review phases" framing turns out to mask significant section-level repetition. Same awk-style dedup approach should work, but section-level rather than task-level. TOC was deferred for this file because adding navigation to duplicate-named sections would be noise.

## Code Quality

### Type Safety (from lint audit)
- [x] Replace `catch (err: any)` with `catch (err: unknown)` + type narrowing (provisioning.ts, TenantEditPanel.tsx)
- [x] Type `app: any` as `FastifyInstance<any, any, any>` in all 25 route modules + fix OAuth callback factory
- [ ] Clean up `any` types in dashboard test mocks (~20 instances)

### Legacy Cleanup
- [x] `vapi/agent.json`, bug-fix markdown files, `fix-vapi-assistant.js/.ts`, `dashboard/test-fetch.js` — all already deleted in prior commits
- [x] `dashboard/server.js` — verified ACTIVE (dev HTTPS server + Railway deploy), not legacy
- [x] `scripts/configure-vapi-agent.sh` — deleted (superseded by provisioning API)
- [x] `n8n/` directory + `docs/N8N_WORKFLOWS.md` — deleted (functionality built into Fastify routes)
- [x] `shift_overrides` → `employee_schedule` rename, `employee_shifts` fallback removed from booking RPCs

### Soft Delete Filtering (BUG-038)
- [x] Add `WHERE is_deleted = false` to SELECT queries in routes touching soft-deletable tables. Audit done 2026-04-30 — most routes already filter (appointments, customers, employees, resources, services, agentTools). Four remaining gaps fixed: `voice.ts:321` (customer phone lookup), `voice.ts:393` (customer ID verify for note add), `agentTools.ts:602` (services CTE in available-time-slots), `analytics.ts:55` (service-employee skill matrix). All 1,468 backend tests pass.
- [ ] Service-layer SELECT queries in CRM/calendar sync code (`hubspotSync`, `squareSync`, `jobberSync`, `servicetitanSync`, `calendarSync`, `syncMapHelpers`) currently include soft-deleted records. Decide whether sync should push deletions to external systems (push the soft-delete state) or just exclude — needs a product call before changing.

---

## CRM Sync Unification (completed 2026-04-17, next steps)

Shared `syncMapHelpers.ts` extracted. Remaining opportunities:
- [ ] Unify calendar token refresh (Google + Outlook duplicate OAuth state/refresh logic)
- [ ] Extract shared tenant bootstrap helper (auth register + admin tenant create duplicate the same flow)

---

## Communications & Reminders Integration

Migrated from ai-secretary, stub implementations need wiring to production DB.

### Phase 1: Database Adapter
- [ ] Create DatabaseService adapter wrapping ai-sec's pool with reminder methods
- [ ] Create `reminder_schedules` table migration
- [ ] Wire TenantConfigService to DB (replace InMemoryTenantConfigService)

### Phase 2: Communications
- [ ] Install and configure nodemailer
- [ ] Install and configure Twilio SDK for SMS
- [ ] Wire email/SMS services to real providers
- [ ] Create tenant notification preferences columns

### Phase 3: Reminders
- [ ] Wire ReminderScheduler to real cron/timer system
- [ ] Connect ReminderProcessor to communications service
- [ ] Add appointment lifecycle hooks (create/update/cancel → schedule/reschedule/cancel reminders)

### Phase 4: Testing
- [ ] Integration tests with real DB for reminder CRUD
- [ ] E2e test: appointment created → reminder scheduled → sent

### Phase 5: Ops
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard for reminder delivery rates
- [ ] Retry logic for failed sends
- [ ] Rate limiting for SMS sends
